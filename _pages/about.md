I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/).

Currently, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I am also a research intern at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), where I am fortunate to advised by Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/).

My research topic lies in the interdisciplinary topics of **reinforcement learning**, and **robotics**. My dream is to **empower robots with the capacity to act in open world environments**. 

I am currently working on leveraging LLM and VLM to boost the generalization ability of robots.
