I am a first year Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). Now I am also working with Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/).

My research topic lies in the interdisciplinary topics of **reinforcement learning**, and **robotics**. My dream is to **empower robots with the capacity to act in open-world environments**. 

I am currently working on leveraging the power of LLM and VLM to boost the performance and generalization ability of robots.
